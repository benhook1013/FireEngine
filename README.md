# FireEngine
A Java based MUD Engine.

Note: This is a library, and as such requires an encompassing Java program to run the server. An example game server will be available eventually.


This engine focuses on use Constructor Injection to allow for ease of configuration and extension. This may be a bit cumbersome and verbose, but I believe it makes it easier to understand for intermediate programmers.
